The simples use case is to use `@Snitch` annotation on the method executed by the job.

----
@Snitch
void doSomething() {
    /// do something
}
----

If you have multiple configuration you should specify which one to use:

----
@Snitch("babecafe")
void doSomething() {
    /// do something
}
----

By default, the provider is notified after the method execution, you can change this using `before` property
of the annotation. In such a case, the report will only send successful messages even if there were an error during the execution.

----
@Snitch(before = true)
void doSomething() {
    /// do something reported at the beginning
}
----

You may also inject `SnitchService` directly into your service. For multiple configurations environment
use `@Named` annotation to retrieve the proper instance:

----

@Singleton
class MyService {

    @Named("babecafe")
    private final SnitchService snitchService;

    public MyService(SnitchService snitchService) {
        this.snitchService = snitchService;
    }

    void doSomething() {
        // do something
        snitchService.snitch();
    }
}
----
